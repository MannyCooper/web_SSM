# web_SSM
Personal website project implemented by SSM

A museum for UI components of operating system(macOS, iOS, and may be windows), including functions like gallery, rating, review, market for the badges of UI components, etc.

Because of the difficulty of collecting all these UI components, this project will be just a demo for SSM, please don't take me seriously on the content of my website (but on my implement and code quality). I'm just picking a random topic I'm interested in.
